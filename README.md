# Node.js Basic Structure

This repository provides a basic structure for building a Node.js backend API. It follows a modular service-oriented architecture, making it easy to organize and maintain your API codebase. Use this structure as a starting point for your Node.js projects.

## Usage

Before running the application, make sure to add a `.env` file in the root directory and configure your environment variables according to your needs.

## Install Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Run the Application

To run the application, you have two options:

1. Run in development mode:

```
npm run dev:start
```

This command starts the application using a development environment configuration, enabling features like automatic reloading when code changes are made.

2. Run in production mode:

```
npm start
```

This command starts the application using a production environment configuration. Use this mode when deploying your application to a production environment.
